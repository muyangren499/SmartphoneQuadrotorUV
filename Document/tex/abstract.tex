The field of autonomous systems control is young, but operational experience is rapidly growing, making research on collaborative systems of great importance. Improving aerial robots in particular could be key in facing future environmental challenges.....
In this work, two main problems are addressed: the cooperative source seeking problem and the cooperative level curve tracking problem by a group of agents under undirected constrained communications. ......
