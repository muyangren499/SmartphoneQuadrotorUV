abstract = {Quadrotors are well suited for executing fast maneu- vers with high accelerations but they are still unable to follow a fast trajectory with centimeter accuracy without iteratively learning it beforehand. In this paper, we present a novel body-rate controller and an iterative thrust-mixing scheme, which improve the trajectory-tracking performance without requiring learning and reduce the yaw control error of a quadrotor, respectively. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, we present the first algorithm to cope with motor saturations smartly by prioritizing control inputs which are relevant for stabilization and trajectory tracking. The presented body-rate controller uses LQR-control methods to consider both the body rate and the single motor dynamics, which reduces the overall trajectory-tracking error while still rejecting external disturbances well. Our iterative thrust-mixing scheme computes the four rotor thrusts given the inputs from a position-control pipeline. Through the iterative computation, we are able to consider a varying ratio of thrust and drag torque of a single propeller over its input range, which allows applying the desired yaw torque more precisely and hence reduces the yaw-control error. Our prioritizing motor-saturation scheme improves stability and robustness of a quadrotor's flight and may prevent unstable behavior in case of motor saturations. We demonstrate the improved trajectory tracking, yaw-control, and robustness in case of motor saturations in real-world exper- iments with a quadrotor.},

abstract = {The continued growth of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) is driving innovation from delivery techniques to military surveillance. Cost and knowledge barriers are major limiting factors to general UAS adoption. A UAS controlled by an onboard smartphone is proposed to leverage consumer understanding and transform the emergent industry. Based upon user-supplied GPS flight path coordinates, the UAS can subsequently take flight, collect relevant data, and safely land without further instruction. This project consists of a 1.5-meter wingspan airplane carrying an Android smartphone connected via IOIO interface to servos that actuate the control surfaces and motor. With the exception of the initial GPS coordinates, no live direction is necessary for operation. Primarily, this level of autonomy was achieved by aggregating a diverse set of known algorithms to collectively validate the feasibility of smartphone-controlled autonomous systems.},

abstract = {This work shows the development of an Android app as a tool for learning concepts of automatic control and dynamic systems. For this purpose, an App to simulate a closed loop control for a mass-spring-damper system was implemented for Android devices. In this closed loop control, the plant and the controller can work together in the same device. This operation type is called stand-alone mode. Another option is to simulate in different devices the controller and the plant. This operation type is called remote mode. A fourth-order Runge-Kutta was used as a numerical method for solving the differential equations of the controller and the plant whichever the operation mode is used. The results of the solution of the differential equation were used to visualize the relevant variables of the system at time domain (position of the mass, control action and reference) and to create an animation. The App allows the plant and the controller to be parameterized independently. Besides, the App lets the user generate perturbations to the controlled system using the device's touch screen or its proximity sensor.},

@phdthesis{Bresciani2008,
abstract = {This thesis work focused on the study of a quadrotor helicopter. The dynamic system modelling and the control algorithm evaluation were carried out. To test the results, a simulator and a real platform were developed. The Newton-Euler formalism was used to model the dynamic system. Particular attention was given to the group composed of the DC-motor, the gear box and the propeller which needed also the estimation of aerodynamic lift and torque to reach better accuracy. PID control algorithms were compared. The first stage tests were performed on a simulated model where it was easy to evaluate the performance with a mathematical approach. The second stage tests were carried out on the quadrotor platform to evaluate the behavior of the real system. A simulator based on Matlab-Simulink was developed. With this program it was possible to test the accuracy of the model and the robustness of the control algorithms. Furthermore a 3D graphic output and a joystick interface made easier the testability and the observability of the system. A quadrotor platform was developed. The electronics was composed of a Micro Control Unit (MCU) interfaced with several devices: the power supply, the receiving unit, the DC-motor power boards, the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), the SONAR and the IR modules. Thanks to these devices and the MCU software, both guided and autonomous flights were possible.},

A variety of sensors including a gyroscope, an accelerometer, and a magnetometer will be used in order to stabilize and control the quadcopter. The development that goes into such a system will be described in detail and a theoretical model will be introduced and simulated. The performance will then be evaluated on the final flight controller by logging the data in real time. Finally, this data will be compared to the simulated results.

abstract = {This paper describes the results obtained in the implementation of a solution implementing real-time precise and accurate attitude and position estimation algorithms designed for control applications based on an Android smartphone. The topic of the paper is in particular the application of this solution to dynamics sensing in a quadrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The attitude estimation is based on an Explicit Complementary Filter (ECF). The position estimation is implemented through a complementary filter using acceleration readings provided by the smartphone sensors and the position derived by a vision based motion capture system. The parameters of the algorithms are tuned through the minimisation of the estimation error for sets of sample acquisitions. Moreover, these settings are chosen in order to minimise the issues related with the fact that Android is not a Real Time Operating System (RTOS). Finally, it was verified that the chosen solution provides performances adequate to the quadrotor stabilisation. The results of a set of experimental tests are used to show the performances of the proposed solution. For the attitude estimation algorithm, a comparison is moreover provided in order to highlight the difference with standard Android orientation estimation algorithm.},

abstract = {This thesis is about modelling, design and control of Miniature Flying Robots (MFR) with a focus on Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) systems and specifically, micro quadrotors. It introduces a mathematical model for simu- lation and control of such systems. It then describes a design methodology for a miniature rotorcraft. The methodology is subsequently applied to design an autonomous quadrotor named OS4. Based on the mathematical model, linear and nonlinear control techniques are used to design and simulate var- ious controllers along this work. The dynamic model and the simulator evolved from a simple set of equa- tions, valid only for hovering, to a complex mathematical model with more realistic aerodynamic coefficients and sensor and actuator models. Two platforms were developed during this thesis. The first one is a quadrotor- like test-bench with off-board data processing and power supply. It was used to safely and easily test control strategies. The second one, OS4, is a highly integrated quadrotor with on-board data processing and power supply. It has all the necessary sensors for autonomous operation. Five different controllers were developed. The first one, based on Lyapunov theory, was applied for attitude control. The second and the third controllers are based on PID and LQ techniques. These were compared for attitude con- trol. The fourth and the fifth approaches use backstepping and sliding-mode concepts. They are applied to control attitude. Finally, backstepping is aug- mented with integral action and proposed as a single tool to design attitude, altitude and position controllers. This approach is validated through various flight experiments conducted on the OS4.},

abstract = {In order for Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) to coexist seamlessly with manned aircraft in non-segregated airspace, enhanced navigational capabilities are essential to meet the Required Navigational Performance (RNP) levels in all flight phases. A Multi-Sensor Data Fusion (MSDF) framework is adopted to improve the navigation capabilities of an integrated Navigation and Guidance System (NGS) designed for small-sized RPAS. The MSDF architecture includes low-cost and low weight/volume navigation sensors suitable for various classes of RPAS. The selected sensors include Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) based Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and Vision Based Sensors (VBS). A loosely integrated navigation architecture is presented where an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is used to combine the navigation sensor measurements. The presented UKF based VBS-INS-GNSS-ADM (U-VIGA) architecture is an evolution of previous research performed on Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) based VBS-INS-GNSS (E-VIGA) systems. An Aircraft Dynamics Model (ADM) is adopted as a virtual sensor and acts as a knowledge-based module providing additional position and attitude information, which is pre-processed by an additional/local UKF. The E-VIGA and U-VIGA performances are evaluated in a small RPAS integration scheme (i.e., AEROSONDE RPAS platform) by exploring a representative cross-section of this RPAS operational flight envelope. The position and attitude accuracy comparison shows that the E-VIGA and U-VIGA systems fulfill the relevant RNP criteria, including precision approach in CAT-II. A novel Human Machine Interface (HMI) architecture is also presented, whose design takes into consideration the coordination tasks of multiple human operators. In addition, the interface scheme incorporates the human operator as an integral part of the control loop providing a higher level of situational awareness.},

In particular, most devices are packaged with a camera, a gyroscope, and an accelerometer, important sensors for aerial robotics. The low mass and small form factor make them particularly well suited for autonomous flight with small flying robots, especially in GPS-denied environments. In this work, we present the first fully autonomous smartphone-based quadrotor. All the computation, sensing and control runs on an off-the- shelf smartphone, with all the software functionality in a smartphone app.We show how quadrotors can be stabilized and controlled to achieve autonomous flight in indoor buildings with application to smart homes, search and rescue, construction and architecture. The work allows any consumer with a smartphone to autonomously drive a quadrotor robot platform, even without GPS, by downloading an app, and concurrently build 3-D maps},

During disasters the main problem is that we can't reach the specific area at exact time, due to the vulnerability, and we have lost a lot of people. But this is possible with real time GPS 3D surveillance. This can be done on the basis of generic term we use GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) for these satellite systems. Here we use these principles to screen the emergency scenario in the surveillance aircraft which have been in the process of surveillance at disaster prone areas. In such emergency scenario, a surveillance aircraft reports back to mission control. Under the accordance to the commands given by the mission control, the surveillance aircraft, which has the quadcopters, will start the rescue mission henceforth. The quadcopter which is on board to perform rescue mission is capable of producing enough thrust to lift the victims. Hence this criterion should be satisfied by specific propeller motors and respective propellers with required strength. Different UAVs can then perform rescue operations or monitor the situation. The rescue operations in UAVs are done by isolating the human.},

@article{ElKholy2014,
abstract = {With the huge advancements in miniature sensors, actuators and processors depend- ing mainly on the Micro and Nano-Electro-Mechanical-Systems (MEMS/NEMS), many researches are now focusing on developing miniature flying vehicles to be used in both research and commercial applications. This thesis work presents a detailed mathematical model for a Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) type Unmanned Aerial Vehicle(UAV) known as the quadrotor. The nonlinear dynamic model of the quadrotor is formulated using the Newton-Euler method, the formulated model is detailed including aerodynamic effects and rotor dynamics that are omitted in many literature. The motion of the quadrotor can be divided into two subsystems; a rotational subsystem (attitude and heading) and a translational subsystem (altitude and x and y motion). Although the quadrotor is a 6 DOF underactuated system, the derived rotational subsystem is fully actuated, while the translational subsystem is underactuated. The derivation of the mathematical model is followed by the development of four control approaches to control the altitude, attitude, heading and position of the quadrotor in space. The first approach is based on the linear Proportional-Derivative- Integral (PID) controller. The second control approach is based on the nonlinear Sliding Mode Controller (SMC). The third developed controller is a nonlinear Back- stepping controller while the fourth is a Gain Scheduling based PID controller. The parameters and gains of the forementioned controllers were tuned using Ge- netic Algorithm (GA) technique to improve the systems dynamic response. Simula- tion based experiments were conducted to evaluate and compare the performance of the four developed control techniques in terms of dynamic performance, stability and the effect of possible disturbances.
